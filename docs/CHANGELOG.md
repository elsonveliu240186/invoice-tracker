## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Scaffolded from the agenticai framework.
- **Client management CRUD** (FEAT-20260511-01) — _no breaking changes_: five REST endpoints
  at `/api/v1/clients` (POST create, GET list with case-insensitive search + pagination capped
  at 100, GET by ID, PUT full-replacement update, DELETE soft-delete); Flyway migration
  `V1__create_clients.sql` with partial unique index on `lower(email) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
  and optimistic-lock `version` column; RFC 7807 `ProblemDetail` error bodies; React feature
  slice at `frontend/src/features/clients/` (page, form modal, table, confirm-delete dialog,
  toast); full test pyramid — JaCoCo ≥ 90% (34 backend tests) and Vitest ≥ 95%/90% branch
  (79 frontend tests); 26 Playwright E2E specs; Postman collection updated with all five client
  requests.
